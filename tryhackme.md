  <summary>Offensive Security Intro</summary>

## Introduction

"To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one." This is the core of **Offensive Security**. It involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access. The goal is to understand hacker tactics and enhance system defences.

In this TryHackMe lesson, you are guided through hacking your first website in a legal and safe environment to see how an ethical hacker operates. The room uses a fake bank application (FakeBank) that you can safely attack using tools like Gobuster to find hidden pages and perform a simulated bank transfer.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **What is Offensive Security?**
  - Simulating a hacker's actions to find vulnerabilities in a system
  - Breaking into systems, exploiting bugs, and finding loopholes to gain unauthorized access
  - Goal: understand attacker tactics to improve defences
- [x] **TryHackMe and Virtual Machines**
  - VMs create simulated environments as practical complements to lessons
  - FakeBank is a prepared fake bank application for safe, legal practice
  - Start the machine via "Start Machine" (or "Show Split View" if needed)
- [x] **Your First Hack – Tool and Steps**
  - **Gobuster**: command-line tool to brute-force a website for hidden directories and pages
  - Takes a wordlist and tries each word against the site; reports existing pages (e.g. Status 200)
- [x] **Step 1: Open a terminal**
  - Terminal (command line) lets you interact with the computer without a GUI
  - On the room machine, open the terminal from the Terminal icon
- [x] **Step 2: Use Gobuster to find hidden pages**
  - Many sites have admin or internal pages (e.g. admin portal, bank transfers)
  - Human error or negligence can leave these pages reachable; attackers look for them
  - Gobuster scans the target URL with a wordlist to discover existing paths
- [x] **Step 3: Hack the bank**
  - Use Gobuster results (e.g. `/bank-transfer`) and visit the hidden page in the browser
  - From there, an attacker could abuse functionality (e.g. transfer money)
  - Ethical hackers find and report such issues so the organisation can fix them
  - Room task: transfer $2000 from account 2276 to 8881, then confirm balance on your account page (refresh if needed)
- [x] **Learning path and careers**
  - Break topics down, focus on an area you like, and practice regularly (e.g. daily on TryHackMe)
  - Example offensive roles: Penetration Tester (find exploitable vulnerabilities), Red Teamer (simulate adversary), Security Engineer (design and maintain security controls)

## Terminal Commands

Gobuster is used to discover hidden directories and pages on a target website. `-u` sets the target URL and `-w` specifies the wordlist; `dir` runs directory/file brute-force mode.

```bash
gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
```

Example output:

```text
=====================================================
Gobuster v2.0.1              OJ Reeves (@TheColonial)
=====================================================
[+] Mode         : dir
[+] Url/Domain   : http://fakebank.thm/
[+] Threads      : 10
[+] Wordlist     : wordlist.txt
[+] Status codes : 200,204,301,302,307,403
[+] Timeout      : 10s
=====================================================
/images (Status: 301)
/bank-transfer (Status: 200)
=====================================================
```

Status 200 indicates a page that exists and was successfully accessed. Use discovered paths (e.g. `/bank-transfer`) in the browser to continue the exercise.

## Code

No code sections in this room; the activity uses terminal commands (Gobuster) and the web interface only.

  <summary>Intro to LAN</summary>

## Introduction

The **Intro to LAN** TryHackMe room builds on basic networking concepts by focusing on Local Area Networks (LANs). You learn about common LAN topologies (star, bus, ring), key devices like switches and routers, how subnetting divides a network into smaller pieces, and how ARP and DHCP support communication and address assignment. The room also uses interactive labs to show how topology flaws and misconfigurations can cause failures or be abused.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **LAN Topologies Overview**
  - A **topology** is the design or layout of a network—how devices are connected.
  - Different topologies have different costs, performance characteristics, and failure modes.
  - The room focuses on star, bus, and ring topologies.
- [x] **Star Topology**
  - Devices are individually connected to a central networking device (usually a switch or hub).
  - Advantages:
    - Very common in modern networks due to reliability and scalability.
    - Easy to add more devices as demand grows.
  - Disadvantages:
    - More expensive because it uses more cabling and dedicated equipment.
    - Increased size leads to more maintenance and harder troubleshooting.
    - The central device is a single point of failure—if it fails, connected devices cannot communicate.
- [x] **Bus Topology**
  - All devices connect to a single **backbone cable**, like leaves on a tree branch.
  - Advantages:
    - Cost-efficient and relatively simple to set up.
    - Requires less cabling and fewer dedicated devices than star topologies.
  - Disadvantages:
    - All data travels along the same cable, making it prone to bottlenecks when many devices send data at once.
    - Troubleshooting is difficult because all traffic shares one path.
    - The backbone cable is a single point of failure; if it breaks, all communication stops.
- [x] **Ring Topology**
  - Devices are connected in a loop, each attached to two neighbours.
  - Often called a **token** topology because a token can circulate to control whose turn it is to send.
  - Advantages:
    - Requires less cabling and less dependence on central hardware than star.
    - Easier to troubleshoot because there is only one direction for data flow.
    - Less prone to bottlenecks than a bus, as traffic is controlled and distributed.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Data may need to pass through many devices before reaching its destination, making it less efficient.
    - A single cut cable or failed device can break the entire loop and bring the network down.
- [x] **Switches**
  - Switches aggregate multiple devices (computers, printers, other networked equipment) using Ethernet.
  - Common in larger networks (businesses, schools) where many ports (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, etc.) are needed.
  - Unlike hubs, switches learn which device is on which port and send packets only to the intended destination, reducing unnecessary traffic.
- [x] **Routers and Routing**
  - A **router** connects different networks and passes data between them.
  - The verb for what routers do is **routing**.
  - Routing is the process of creating and using paths so data can travel across multiple networks.
  - Routers are especially useful in environments with multiple possible paths, enabling resilience and controlled traffic flows.
  - Switches and routers can be connected together to increase redundancy by providing multiple paths; if one path fails, another can carry the traffic (with a potential performance trade-off).
- [x] **Interactive Topology Lab**
  - An interactive lab lets you explore how each topology can break.
  - You intentionally introduce failures (like cutting cables) to see their impact and retrieve the flag `THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}`.
- [x] **Subnetting Basics**
  - **Subnetting** is dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks (subnets).
  - Analogy: slicing a cake into pieces to share among friends; subnetting decides who gets which slice of address space.
  - Example organisational departments that might get distinct subnets:
    - Accounting
    - Finance
    - Human Resources
  - Subnetting is represented by a **subnet mask**, also made of four octets (32 bits), each ranging from 0–255.
  - Subnets use IP addresses in three main ways:
    - **Network Address** – identifies the start of the network (e.g. `192.168.1.0`).
    - **Host Address** – identifies individual devices on the network (e.g. `192.168.1.100`).
    - **Default Gateway** – a device that can send data to other networks (often `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.1.254`).
  - In small home networks, one subnet is usually enough (up to ~254 hosts).
  - Larger environments (offices, campuses) need subnetting for:
    - Efficiency
    - Security
    - Administrative control
  - Example: a café might have one subnet for internal devices (employees, cash registers) and another for public Wi‑Fi users.
- [x] **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
  - ARP links IP addresses (logical identifiers) to MAC addresses (physical identifiers).
  - Each device keeps an ARP **cache** with mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses.
  - ARP uses two packet types:
    - **ARP Request** – broadcast asking “Who has this IP address? Tell me your MAC.”
    - **ARP Reply** – unicast response from the device that owns the IP, providing its MAC.
  - This process allows devices to discover each other’s physical identifiers and communicate on the LAN.
- [x] **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
  - DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses instead of requiring manual configuration.
  - When a device joins a network, it follows a 4-step exchange:
    - **DHCP Discover** – the device broadcasts to find a DHCP server.
    - **DHCP Offer** – the server offers an available IP address.
    - **DHCP Request** – the device requests to use the offered address.
    - **DHCP ACK** – the server acknowledges and confirms the lease.
  - This automation simplifies IP management, especially in large LANs.

  <summary>Defensive Security Intro</summary>

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, you focused on offensive security: identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities to strengthen defences. This lesson introduces **defensive security**, which is primarily concerned with **preventing intrusions** and **detecting and responding to them** when they occur. Blue teams operate on the defensive side, using processes, tools, and analysis to protect systems and data.

Defensive security spans tasks such as user awareness training, asset management, patching, deploying firewalls and IPS, enabling logging and monitoring, and running specialised functions like SOC operations, threat intelligence, DFIR, and malware analysis.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **What is Defensive Security?**
  - Focused on preventing intrusions from occurring
  - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
  - Typically associated with blue teams and defence-focused roles
- [x] **Core Defensive Tasks**
  - User cyber security awareness: training users to resist attacks targeting their systems
  - Documenting and managing assets: knowing what systems/devices you must protect
  - Updating and patching systems: closing known vulnerabilities across endpoints and servers
  - Setting up preventative devices: firewalls and IPS to filter and block malicious traffic
  - Logging and monitoring: collecting logs and monitoring for suspicious or unauthorized activity
- [x] **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
  - Team of security professionals monitoring networks and systems for malicious events
  - Watches for vulnerabilities, policy violations, unauthorized activity, and intrusions
  - Often uses SIEM tools to aggregate events and generate alerts
- [x] **Threat Intelligence**
  - Intelligence = information about current and potential adversaries and threats
  - Collects data from local (e.g. network logs) and public (e.g. forums) sources
  - Processes and analyzes data to understand adversaries’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
  - Outputs recommendations and actionable steps to achieve threat‑informed defence
- [x] **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**
  - Digital forensics: investigates evidence of attacks and related crimes
  - Key evidence sources: file system images, memory dumps, system logs, network logs
  - Incident response: methodology to handle cyber incidents to reduce damage and recover quickly
  - Four main IR phases: Preparation; Detection and Analysis; Containment, Eradication and Recovery; Post‑Incident Activity
- [x] **Malware and Malware Analysis**
  - Malware = malicious software (virus, trojan horse, ransomware, etc.)
  - Viruses attach to programs and spread, altering/overwriting/deleting files
  - Trojans appear legitimate but hide malicious functionality
  - Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment for decryption
  - Static analysis: study malware without running it (often at assembly level)
  - Dynamic analysis: run malware in a controlled environment and observe behaviour
- [x] **Defensive Work in Practice (SOC Scenario)**
  - SOC analysts triage SIEM alerts, distinguishing benign from malicious activity
  - Examples: multiple failed logins (possibly user error or brute force), connections from unknown IPs
  - Analysts investigate, correlate events, and identify indicators such as flags (e.g. `THM{THREAT-BLOCKED}`) during exercises

## Terminal Commands

This room is largely conceptual and interface‑driven (SIEM simulation, dashboards) rather than command‑line heavy; there are no specific terminal commands required beyond interacting with the training environment.

```bash
# No primary terminal command focus in this defensive room
```

## Code

There is no code implementation focus in this lesson. Instead, it emphasises processes (SOC, DFIR, IR phases) and analysis of alerts, logs, and malware behaviour.

- [x] Post‑Incident Activity.

</details>

### Question 14: What is ransomware and how does it impact victims?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Ransomware is malware that encrypts a user’s files and demands payment (a ransom) in exchange for the decryption key, denying access to data until the ransom is paid or recovery is performed.

</details>

### Question 15: How does a trojan horse differ from a typical virus?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Trojan**: appears to offer a legitimate or desirable function but secretly performs malicious actions
- [x] **Virus**: attaches to other programs and replicates by infecting additional files or systems

</details>

### Question 16: What is static malware analysis?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Analysing malware **without executing** it (often by examining its code or binary)
- [x] Typically requires knowledge of low‑level instructions such as **assembly**

</details>

### Question 17: What is dynamic malware analysis?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Running malware in a **controlled environment** and monitoring its behaviour
- [x] Examples of what you observe: **file** changes, **network** connections, **process** activity

</details>

### Question 18: In the SIEM simulation scenario, what is the purpose of the flag `THM{THREAT-BLOCKED}`?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] It serves as proof that you successfully followed the investigation steps in the simulated SIEM environment and identified the correct malicious activity or outcome.

</details>

## Summary

This lesson shifts from attacking to defending, showing how blue teams work to prevent, detect, and respond to threats. You learned about defensive tasks such as awareness, asset management, patching, firewalls and IPS, logging and monitoring, and specialised areas like SOC operations, threat intelligence, DFIR, and malware analysis. The scenario with a SIEM and alerts illustrates how analysts triage events and identify real threats. Together, these concepts form the foundation of a robust, threat‑informed defensive posture.

  <summary>Defensive Security Intro 2</summary>

## Introduction

This TryHackMe room introduces defensive security from the defender’s point of view. Rather than attacking systems, you focus on monitoring, detecting suspicious activity, and responding to potential attacks before damage occurs. In this exercise, you work with a simulated monitoring dashboard to review alerts, identify malicious behaviour, and take action to stop an attack against a fake bank.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Goal of Defensive Security**
  - Defensive security is the process of defending and securing devices and systems.
  - The main goal is to detect and respond to attacks before they cause harm.
  - Unlike offensive security, you do not attack systems; you monitor and protect them.
- [x] **Understanding Suspicious Activity and Alerts**
  - Activity that does not look normal is considered suspicious and is captured as alerts.
  - Defenders review alerts to decide what needs deeper investigation.
  - The monitoring dashboard in this room represents a real-world tool used in SOC environments.
- [x] **Working with the Monitoring Dashboard**
  - You open the monitoring dashboard on the provided virtual machine.
  - You review recent alerts to spot unusual traffic patterns or IPs.
  - One of the core tasks is identifying the suspicious source IP address.
- [x] **Identifying the Attack**
  - After spotting suspicious activity, defenders determine what kind of attack is taking place.
  - The room provides a “URL Discovery Attempts” list where you can see what URLs the attacker is probing.
  - By reviewing the latest entry, you learn which sensitive URL the attacker is trying to access.
- [x] **Stopping and Containing the Attack**
  - Once the attack is understood, defenders can block the attacker’s IP address.
  - Additional measures include applying rate limits so no one can overwhelm the system.
  - Updating security rules and adding defensive controls help prevent similar attacks in the future.
  - Stopping the attacker while you investigate and fix vulnerabilities is known as containment.

This room is primarily focused on using a graphical monitoring dashboard and simulated controls rather than running terminal commands. You interact with the interface to view alerts, identify the malicious IP, and apply blocking and rate-limiting actions.

```bash
# No primary terminal command focus in this defensive room;
# actions are taken via the monitoring dashboard UI.
```

## Code

There is no specific code implementation in this exercise. The emphasis is on understanding alerts, recognising suspicious behaviour, and applying defensive actions (blocking IPs, rate limiting, updating rules) through the simulated environment.

```py
# No code samples for this defensive security exercise
```

## Questions and Answers

### Question 1: What is the main goal of defensive security?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The main goal of defensive security is to detect and respond to attacks before they cause damage to systems or data.

</details>

### Question 2: How does defensive security differ from offensive security in this context?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Defensive security**: monitor and protect systems, focusing on detection and response
- [x] **Offensive security**: actively attempt to exploit systems to find weaknesses

</details>

### Question 3: What type of information is stored as an alert in the monitoring system?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Alerts store pieces of information about suspicious or unusual activity observed on the system or network.

</details>

### Question 4: Which source IP address is generating the suspicious traffic in this room?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The suspicious traffic is generated by the source IP address `32.122.195.63`.

</details>

### Question 5: Where in the dashboard do you look to understand what URLs the attacker is trying to access?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] You look at the “URL Discovery Attempts” list and review the latest entry.

</details>

### Question 6: What is the latest URL that the attacker has attempted to access?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The latest URL the attacker tried to find is `https://fakebank.com/admin`.

</details>

### Question 7: Why do defenders care about URLs like `/admin` on a banking site?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Such URLs often expose administrative or sensitive functionality
- [x] If attackers discover and exploit them, they may gain powerful access or control over the system

</details>

### Question 8: What defensive actions do you take once the attack has been identified?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Block the attacker’s IP address
- [x] Apply rate limits to prevent overwhelming traffic
- [x] Update security rules
- [x] Add further measures to prevent the attack from recurring

</details>

### Question 9: What is meant by containment in the context of this exercise?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Containment means stopping the attacker from continuing (for example, by blocking their IP and limiting traffic) while you investigate and remediate underlying vulnerabilities.

</details>

### Question 10: What flag do you receive after successfully applying the defensive measures?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] You receive the flag `THM{FAKEBANK-SECURED}` once the success message appears after stopping the attack.

</details>

### Question 11: Why is reviewing recent alerts an important first step for defenders?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Reviewing recent alerts helps defenders quickly spot abnormal activity that may indicate an ongoing or emerging attack, allowing them to prioritise investigations and responses.

</details>

### Question 12: How does this room simulate real-world defensive work?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] It uses a virtual machine and monitoring dashboard to replicate how defenders review alerts
- [x] You investigate suspicious IPs and URLs
- [x] You apply controls like blocking and rate limiting to protect a production-like system

</details>

## Summary

In this TryHackMe room, you approach security from the defender’s perspective. You monitor a simulated banking environment, review alerts, identify a suspicious source IP and an attacker probing an admin URL, and then apply defensive actions such as IP blocking, rate limiting, and updating rules. The exercise reinforces the core idea that defensive security is about early detection, investigation, and containment of attacks to keep systems secure.

## 2-Network Fundamentals

<details>
  <summary>What is Networking?</summary>

## Introduction

The **What is Networking?** TryHackMe room introduces networking from first principles and ties it to everyday examples. You learn that networks are simply things that are connected—whether that is a city’s transport system, the power grid, or computing devices like phones and laptops. The room then scales up to explain the Internet, IP and MAC addressing, IPv4 vs IPv6, and basic tools like `ping`, all of which are foundational for later cyber security work.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **What is a Network?**
  - A network is a collection of things that are connected.
  - Everyday examples include public transport systems, power grids, postal systems, and social circles.
  - In computing, the same concept applies to technological devices that communicate and share data.
  - Networks in computing can range from 2 devices to billions (laptops, phones, cameras, traffic lights, farming sensors, etc.).
  - Because networks underpin so many aspects of modern life, understanding networking is essential in cyber security.
- [x] **The Internet as a Giant Network**
  - The Internet is a giant network made up of many smaller networks.
  - The room uses an example of Alice, Bob, Jim, and new friends Zayn and Toby to show how someone who can speak multiple “languages” can connect groups together.
  - Historically, ARPANET in the late 1960s was an early network funded by the U.S. Defence Department.
  - In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web (WWW), transforming the Internet into a global information repository.
  - The Internet can be seen as many small **private networks** interconnected by **public networks**.
- [x] **Private vs Public Networks**
  - A **private network** is a smaller network (e.g. your home or office network) where devices communicate with one another.
  - A **public network** (the Internet) connects many private networks together.
  - Devices use labels to identify themselves, enabling ordered communication.
  - The room emphasises that devices must be identifiable, similar to how people are identified by names and fingerprints.
- [x] **IP Addresses**
  - Devices have two main identifiers:
    - An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) that can change over time.
    - A **MAC address** that is more permanent (like a serial number).
  - An IPv4 address is made up of four sections called **octets**.
  - IP addressing & subnetting determine how these numbers are allocated, but the key idea is that one IP cannot be active on more than one device inside the same network at the same time.
  - IP addresses follow protocols so that devices can “speak the same language”.
  - Devices can have:
    - A **private IP address** used within a local network.
    - A **public IP address** used on the Internet, typically assigned by an ISP.
- [x] **Public and Private IP Examples**
  - Example devices:
    - `DESKTOP-KJE57FD` with private `192.168.1.77` and public `86.157.52.21`.
    - `CMNatic-PC` with private `192.168.1.74` and the same public `86.157.52.21`.
  - Both devices can communicate privately using their private IP addresses.
  - When either device accesses the Internet, the public IP (from the ISP) is what outside services see.
  - Public IPs are scarce and managed because of the huge number of connected devices.
- [x] **IPv4 vs IPv6**
  - IPv4 supports about \(2^{32}\) addresses (~4.29 billion), which is not enough for the projected number of devices.
  - Cisco estimated tens of billions of devices would be online, making address exhaustion a real problem.
  - IPv6 is a newer protocol version providing up to \(2^{128}\) addresses (340 trillion-plus), solving the exhaustion issue.
  - IPv6 also introduces more efficient methodologies, though the addressing format looks more complex.
- [x] **MAC Addresses**
  - Every network interface has a physical network interface card (NIC) with a factory-assigned **MAC address**.
  - A MAC address is a 12-character hexadecimal number split by colons (e.g. `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`).
  - The first half (OUI) identifies the manufacturer; the second half is a unique identifier.
  - MAC addresses can be **spoofed**, where a device pretends to be another by copying its MAC.
  - Poor security that relies only on MAC-based trust can be bypassed by spoofing.
- [x] **MAC Filtering and Guest Wi-Fi Scenario**
  - Cafes, hotels, and similar locations often use MAC address control on guest/public Wi‑Fi.
  - They may grant better service or access only to paid devices.
  - In the lab scenario, a router allows Alice’s paid device while discarding Bob’s packets.
  - Spoofing Bob’s MAC to match Alice’s shows how MAC control can be abused if used alone.
- [x] **Ping and ICMP**
  - `ping` is a fundamental network tool using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
  - It tests if a connection exists and how reliable it is by sending ICMP echo requests and waiting for echo replies.
  - Ping measures round-trip time and packet loss between devices.
  - It can be run against local devices (private IPs) or public resources (websites).
  - Example: pinging `192.168.1.254` and seeing multiple ICMP packets sent and received with an average time.
  - In the lab, you ping `8.8.8.8` to reveal a flag.

## Terminal Commands

The main command-line tool introduced is `ping`, which tests connectivity and latency between devices using ICMP.

```bash
# Basic ping syntax
ping 10.10.10.10

# Example from the room
ping 8.8.8.8
```

On most systems, `ping` will send multiple packets and show statistics including packets sent/received and average round-trip time.

## Code

This room focuses on conceptual networking foundations and simple command-line usage rather than programming. There are no specific code samples to implement; instead you practice using built-in tools like `ping` and visualise IP and MAC addressing.

```py
# No programming examples in this networking fundamentals room.
```

</details>

### Question 8: Why was IPv6 introduced?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] To provide a vastly larger address space and new efficiencies because IPv4’s ~4.29 billion addresses are insufficient for the growing number of connected devices.

</details>

### Question 9: What does the term “MAC” stand for and what is its purpose?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **MAC** stands for **Media Access Control**

</details>

### Question 10: What security risk is associated with relying solely on MAC addresses for access control?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] MAC addresses can be spoofed, so an attacker can impersonate a trusted device and bypass simple MAC-based access controls.

</details>

### Question 11: In the hotel Wi‑Fi scenario, what happens when Bob spoofs Alice’s MAC address?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The router treats Bob’s traffic as if it were Alice’s paid device, allowing his packets through and granting him access he did not pay for.

</details>

### Question 12: What protocol does `ping` use, and what does it measure?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] `ping` uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and measures connectivity and round‑trip time between devices.

</details>

### Question 13: What is the correct syntax to ping the IP address `10.10.10.10`?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The syntax is: `ping 10.10.10.10`.

<details>
  <summary>Intro to LAN</summary>

## Introduction

The **Intro to LAN** TryHackMe room explores how Local Area Networks (LANs) are designed and operated. It focuses on common topologies (star, bus, ring), key devices like switches and routers, and concepts such as subnetting, ARP, and DHCP. You also complete an interactive lab where you intentionally break LAN topologies to understand their weaknesses and retrieve the flag `THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}`.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **LAN Topologies Overview**
  - A **topology** is the design or layout of a network—how devices are physically and logically connected.
  - LANs can be built using different topologies, each with unique advantages, costs, and failure modes.
- [x] **Star Topology**
  - Devices are individually connected to a central networking device, such as a switch or hub.
  - This is the most commonly found topology today because of its reliability and scalability.
  - More cabling and dedicated equipment make it more expensive than other topologies.
  - As the network grows, maintenance and troubleshooting become more complex.
  - The central device is a single point of failure: if it fails, connected devices can no longer communicate.
- [x] **Bus Topology**
  - All devices share a single **backbone cable** from which they branch, like leaves off a tree.
  - Because all data travels along the same cable, the network can become slow and **bottlenecked** when many devices send data at once.
  - Troubleshooting is harder because all traffic shares one path, making it difficult to isolate issues.
  - It is cost‑efficient and relatively simple to set up, using less cabling and fewer dedicated devices.
  - A break in the backbone cable is a critical single point of failure; if it breaks, no devices can communicate.
- [x] **Ring Topology**
  - Devices are connected in a closed loop, each connected directly to two neighbours.
  - Sometimes called a **token** topology because devices pass control in turn.
  - Data circulates around the ring until it reaches the destination; a device forwards traffic if it has none of its own to send.
  - Because data flows in one direction, faults are relatively easy to troubleshoot.
  - However, traffic may have to traverse many devices before reaching the target, which is inefficient.
  - The design is less prone to bottlenecks than a bus, but a single cut cable or failed device can break the entire ring.
- [x] **Switches**
  - Switches are dedicated devices that aggregate multiple networked devices (PCs, printers, etc.) via Ethernet.
  - Common in larger environments (businesses, schools) where many ports (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, etc.) are required.
  - Unlike hubs, switches keep track of which device is on which port (MAC learning) and send packets only to the intended destination.
  - This selective forwarding reduces unnecessary traffic and improves overall network efficiency.
- [x] **Routers and Routing**
  - A **router** connects different networks and passes data between them.
  - **Routing** is the process of creating and using paths between networks so data can be delivered end‑to‑end.
  - Routing becomes especially useful when multiple paths exist between networks, enabling redundancy and resilience.
  - Switches and routers can be combined to create multiple paths; if one path fails, another can still carry traffic, trading some performance for reliability.
- [x] **Subnetting Basics**
  - **Subnetting** is splitting a larger network into smaller subnetworks (subnets), like slicing a cake into pieces for different groups.
  - Organisations may subnet for departments such as Accounting, Finance, and Human Resources.
  - A subnet is described by a **subnet mask**, also made up of four octets (32 bits), each in the range 0–255.
  - IP addresses in a subnet are used in three main ways:
    - **Network Address** – identifies the start of the network (e.g. `192.168.1.0`).
    - **Host Address** – identifies individual devices (e.g. `192.168.1.100`).
    - **Default Gateway** – a device that can send data to other networks (commonly `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.1.254`).
  - Small home networks typically live on a single subnet, but larger networks use subnetting for:
    - **Efficiency** – better use of address space and traffic control.
    - **Security** – segmenting sensitive systems from general users.
    - **Full control** – administrative separation of departments or functions.
  - Example: a café may use one subnet for internal devices (staff, tills) and another for public Wi‑Fi.
- [x] **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
  - Devices have two identifiers: a logical **IP address** and a physical **MAC address**.
  - **ARP** maps IP addresses to MAC addresses so devices can communicate on a LAN.
  - Each device maintains an **ARP cache**, a ledger of IP‑to‑MAC mappings.
  - ARP uses two key packet types:
    - **ARP Request** – broadcast: “Who has this IP address? Tell me your MAC.”
    - **ARP Reply** – unicast response from the device that owns the IP, returning its MAC.
  - Once learned, mappings are stored in the cache for future use.
- [x] **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
  - Devices can be assigned IP addresses manually or automatically using **DHCP**.
  - When a device joins a network without a configured IP, it follows a four‑step DHCP exchange:
    - **DHCP Discover** – the device broadcasts to find DHCP servers.
    - **DHCP Offer** – a server responds with an available IP address and configuration.
    - **DHCP Request** – the device requests to use the offered address.
    - **DHCP ACK** – the server acknowledges the assignment so the device can begin using the IP.
- [x] **Interactive Topology Lab**
  - The attached lab lets you interact with star, bus, and ring topologies and intentionally break them.
  - You explore how single points of failure and design weaknesses cause outages.
  - Completing the lab and breaking the topologies as instructed yields the flag `THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}`.

</details>

### Question 3: Why is the star topology so common in modern networks?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Because it is reliable and scalable—devices are individually connected to a central device, making it easy to add more devices as demand grows.

</details>

### Question 4: What is the main cost‑related disadvantage of a star topology?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] It requires more cabling and dedicated networking equipment, making it more expensive to set up and maintain than simpler topologies.

</details>

### Question 5: What is the central single point of failure in a star topology?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The central device (such as a switch or hub); if it fails, all connected devices lose connectivity.

</details>

### Question 6: Why can a bus topology quickly become slow or bottlenecked?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Because all devices share a single backbone cable, so simultaneous data transmissions compete for the same path and create congestion.

</details>

### Question 7: What makes troubleshooting a bus topology difficult?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] All traffic travels along one cable, so pinpointing which device or segment is causing problems is challenging.

</details>

### Question 8: What is the critical single point of failure in a bus topology?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The backbone cable itself—if it breaks, devices can no longer send or receive data along the bus.

</details>

### Question 9: How are devices connected in a ring topology?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Each device is connected directly to two neighbours, forming a closed loop through which data circulates.

</details>

### Question 10: Why is a ring topology relatively easy to troubleshoot but potentially inefficient?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Data travels in a single direction, simplifying fault location, but it may have to pass through many devices before reaching its destination, which is inefficient.

</details>

### Question 11: What is the primary job of a switch on a LAN?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] To connect multiple devices and intelligently forward packets only to the correct destination port, reducing unnecessary traffic.

- [x] It is the device responsible for sending data to other networks when the destination is not on the local subnet.

</details>

### Question 17: What does ARP stand for, and what problem does it solve?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] ARP stands for **Address Resolution Protocol**
- [x] It maps IP addresses to MAC addresses so devices can find each other’s physical identifiers and communicate on a LAN

</details>

### Question 18: Which ARP packet asks “Who has this IP address?” and which packet responds?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] An **ARP Request** asks who owns a specific IP address
- [x] An **ARP Reply** responds with the MAC address of the device that owns that IP

</details>

### Question 19: Which address is the physical identifier for a device, and which is the logical identifier?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The **MAC address** is the physical identifier
- [x] The **IP address** is the logical identifier

### Question 21: What flag do you receive at the end of the LAN topology lab when you successfully break the topologies?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] You receive the flag `THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}`.

</details>

## Summary

The Intro to LAN room explains how local area networks can be built using different topologies—star, bus, and ring—and what trade‑offs each design introduces in terms of cost, scalability, and reliability. It shows how switches and routers move traffic efficiently, how subnetting divides a larger network into smaller, manageable pieces, and how ARP and DHCP help devices discover each other and automatically obtain IP addresses. Through an interactive lab, you see how single points of failure and design weaknesses can break networks and practice reasoning about resilience. Together, these concepts give you a solid foundation for understanding and troubleshooting LANs.

  <summary>OSI Model</summary>

## Introduction

The **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a fundamental networking framework that standardises how devices send, receive, and interpret data. It defines seven distinct layers, from the physical transmission of bits up to the user-facing application layer, so that diverse hardware and software can interoperate reliably. As data passes down and up these layers, additional information is added and removed in a process called **encapsulation**.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **OSI Model Overview**
  - OSI stands for **Open Systems Interconnection**.
  - The model has **7 layers**, numbered from Layer 1 (Physical) to Layer 7 (Application).
  - Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts only with adjacent layers.
  - **Encapsulation** is the process of adding layer‑specific information (headers, trailers) to data as it descends through the stack.
- [x] **Layer 1 – Physical**
  - Concerned with the **physical components** and media that carry bits (0s and 1s).
  - Uses electrical, optical, or radio signals to represent the binary **numbering system** (1s and 0s).
  - Examples include **Ethernet cables** and other cabling/hardware that physically connect devices.
- [x] **Layer 2 – Data Link**
  - Handles **physical addressing** and framing for data on the same network.
  - Adds the **MAC address** of the receiving endpoint to frames.
  - Every networked device has a **Network Interface Card (NIC)** with a unique burned‑in MAC address (though it can be spoofed).
  - Responsible for presenting data in a format suitable for physical transmission.
- [x] **Layer 3 – Network**
  - Responsible for **routing** and reassembly of packets across multiple networks.
  - Works with **IP addresses** (e.g. `192.168.1.100`), deciding how packets traverse routers.
  - Protocols such as **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** and **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** help determine optimal paths based on:
    - Shortest path (fewest hops).
    - Reliability (loss history).
    - Link speed (e.g. copper vs fibre).
  - Devices like routers that operate here are called **Layer 3 devices**.
- [x] **Layer 4 – Transport**
  - Manages end‑to‑end transport of data using **TCP** or **UDP**.
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
    - Connection‑oriented and focused on **reliability and accuracy**.
    - Maintains a reserved connection while data is sent and received.
    - Performs **error checking** and ensures packets are received and reassembled in order.
    - Used by applications that require complete and correct data, such as file downloads, web browsing, and email.
    - Disadvantages: slower and more resource‑intensive; can bottleneck if the connection is unreliable.
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
    - Connectionless and **faster** than TCP.
    - No guarantee or error correction—data may be lost without retransmission.
    - Leaves rate control and reliability to the application, making it flexible but less safe.
    - Used where some loss is acceptable, e.g. **video streaming** or small discovery protocols like **ARP** and **DHCP**.
- [x] **Layer 5 – Session**
  - Creates, manages, and terminates **sessions** between devices.
  - A **session** exists while a connection is successfully established and active.
  - Can use **checkpoints** so that if a connection drops, only the most recent data needs to be resent.
  - Sessions are **unique**, and data does not cross between different sessions.
- [x] **Layer 6 – Presentation**
  - Acts as a **translator** for data between the Application layer and lower layers.
  - Ensures that data is formatted in a standard way so different software (e.g. different email clients) can interpret it consistently.
  - Handles **data encryption and decryption**, such as HTTPS for secure web traffic.
- [x] **Layer 7 – Application**
  - Closest to the **end user**, defining how users interact with networked data.
  - Everyday software like **email clients**, **web browsers**, and **FTP clients** (e.g. FileZilla) live here.
  - Provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and uses protocols like **DNS** to translate domain names into IP addresses.
- [x] **OSI Dungeon Practical**
  - A gamified exercise where you climb layers of the OSI model in the correct order.
  - Escaping the dungeon rewards you with the flag `THM{OSI_DUNGEON_ESCAPED}` and reinforces layer ordering.

## Summary

The OSI Model organises networking into seven logical layers, from the physical movement of bits up to the user‑facing applications. Each layer has a specific role: the Physical and Data Link layers handle signals and local addressing, the Network and Transport layers route and reliably deliver data using IP, TCP, and UDP, and the Session, Presentation, and Application layers manage sessions, translation, security, and user interaction. By understanding how encapsulation works and what happens at each layer, you can reason about where problems occur, why certain protocols are used, and how different systems interoperate. Hands‑on activities like the OSI dungeon reinforce layer order and responsibilities through practice.

<details>
  <summary>Packets & Frames</summary>

## Introduction

The **Packets & Frames** TryHackMe room explains how data is broken into smaller units for transmission and how different protocols and models describe this process. At Layer 3 of the OSI model, **packets** carry IP information, while at Layer 2, **frames** encapsulate packets with MAC addressing. The room also introduces the TCP/IP model, TCP vs UDP behaviour (including the three‑way handshake), port numbers, and a few hands‑on challenges with flags.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Packets vs Frames**
  - A **packet** is a unit of data at **Layer 3 (Network)** and includes IP addressing information plus a payload.
  - A **frame** is a unit of data at **Layer 2 (Data Link)** that encapsulates a packet and adds MAC addresses and other link‑layer details.
  - Analogy: the **frame** is the envelope that carries the letter (the **packet**) through the postal system; once opened, the letter can be processed or forwarded.
  - The process of adding these headers as data moves through layers is **encapsulation**.
  - When the encapsulating information is stripped off, you are looking at the underlying packet or data itself.
- [x] **Why Packets Are Useful**
  - Data is split into smaller pieces (packets) instead of being sent as one large message.
  - This reduces the chance of **bottlenecks** and improves efficiency when many devices share a network.
  - Example: when loading an image from a website, the image is broken into several packets and then **reconstructed** on the receiving device.
- [x] **IP Packet Headers**
  - Packets using the Internet Protocol (IP) have standardised headers that help devices handle and route data.
  - Important IP headers include:
    - **Time to Live (TTL)** – sets an expiry for the packet so it does not circulate indefinitely and clog the network.
    - **Checksum** – provides integrity checking; if the computed value on receipt differs, the packet is considered corrupt.
    - **Source Address** – the IP address of the sending device so responses know where to return.
    - **Destination Address** – the IP address of the target device so routers know where to forward the packet.
- [x] **TCP/IP Model Overview**
  - The **TCP/IP model** is a four‑layer model that parallels the OSI model in a simplified form:
    - **Application**
    - **Transport**
    - **Internet**
    - **Network Interface**
  - Like the OSI model, information is added at each layer as packets traverse the stack (encapsulation) and removed in reverse (decapsulation).
- [x] **TCP Basics and Reliability**
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is connection‑based and emphasises reliability.
  - Before data is sent, TCP must establish a connection between client and server.
  - Because of this, TCP **guarantees** that data sent will be received in order at the other end, or it will be retransmitted.
  - Advantages:
    - Integrity of data is guaranteed.
    - Can synchronise devices to avoid flooding or reordering issues.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Requires a reliable connection; if small chunks are lost, larger units may need to be resent.
    - Slower than UDP due to extra processing and connection maintenance.
- [x] **TCP Headers**
  - Key TCP header fields include:
    - **Source Port** – random high port on the sender used to send the packet.
    - **Destination Port** – the port where a service is listening on the receiver (e.g. port 80 for a web server).
    - **Source IP** – IP address of the sender.
    - **Destination IP** – IP address of the receiver.
    - **Sequence Number** – initial random number assigned to the first piece of data to track ordering.
    - **Acknowledgement Number** – used to confirm receipt; typically previous sequence number + 1.
    - **Checksum** – integrity check; if recalculated value differs, data is corrupt.
    - **Data** – the actual payload being transferred.
    - **Flag** – indicates how to handle the packet during connection setup and teardown (e.g. SYN, ACK, FIN, RST).
- [x] **TCP Three‑Way Handshake**
  - The **three‑way handshake** establishes a reliable TCP connection:
    - **SYN** – client initiates connection and proposes an Initial Sequence Number (ISN).
    - **SYN/ACK** – server responds with its own ISN and acknowledges the client’s.
    - **ACK** – client acknowledges the server’s ISN; the connection is established.
  - After this, **DATA** packets carry the payload, and finally:
    - **FIN** – used to close the connection cleanly.
    - **RST** – used to abruptly terminate communication when something goes wrong.
- [x] **TCP Closing a Connection**
  - When a device determines that all data has been successfully sent and received, it should close the TCP connection to free resources.
  - A **FIN** packet is sent to initiate closure and must be acknowledged by the other side.
  - Both sides exchange FIN and ACK as part of a graceful shutdown.
- [x] **UDP Basics**
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is **stateless** and does not require a three‑way handshake.
  - There is no synchronisation, acknowledgement, or built‑in integrity checking beyond basic mechanisms.
  - UDP is useful where:
    - Some data loss is acceptable (e.g. video streaming, voice chat).
    - High speed and low overhead are more important than guaranteed delivery.
  - Trade‑offs:
    - Faster and simpler than TCP.
    - Does not care whether data is received; unstable connections can cause poor user experience.
- [x] **UDP Headers**
  - UDP packets have fewer headers but share some with IP:
    - **Time to Live (TTL)** – expiry timer.
    - **Source Address** – IP of the sender.
    - **Destination Address** – IP of the receiver.
    - **Source Port** – randomly chosen port used by the sender.
    - **Destination Port** – port where the application or service is listening.
    - **Data** – payload.
- [x] **Ports and Services**
  - Ports are numeric identifiers (0–65535) that allow multiple applications to share a single IP address.
  - Common ports (0–1024) are reserved for standard services:
    - **FTP (21)** – File Transfer Protocol for client‑server file sharing.
    - **SSH (22)** – Secure Shell for remote text‑based management.
    - **HTTP (80)** – unencrypted web traffic.
    - **HTTPS (443)** – encrypted web traffic.
    - **SMB (445)** – file and printer sharing.
    - **RDP (3389)** – Remote Desktop Protocol for graphical remote access.
  - Services can run on non‑standard ports (e.g. HTTP on 8080), but clients must know and specify the port (often using `:<port>` in URLs).
- [x] **Practical Challenges and Flags**
  - One challenge has you reconstruct a TCP handshake conversation between Alice and Bob to understand the sequence of SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK messages, yielding the flag `THM{TCP_CHATTER}`.
  - Another challenge involves connecting to IP `8.8.8.8` on port `1234`, which returns the flag `THM{YOU_CONNECTED_TO_A_PORT}`.
  - Additional tasks reinforce concepts of TCP vs UDP, and using ports in practice.

## Terminal Commands

This room is primarily conceptual and uses static or browser‑based labs rather than heavy command‑line interaction. You may, however, conceptually work with tools like `netcat` or similar to connect to specific IP:port combinations in practical challenges.

```bash
# Example (conceptual) usage to connect to a host and port:
nc 8.8.8.8 1234
```

## Code

There is no dedicated programming component; instead, you focus on how network protocols structure and move data. Any code‑like interactions are typically done through network tools or lab interfaces.

```py
# No direct code samples for the Packets & Frames room.
```

## Summary

The Packets & Frames room deepens your understanding of how data is structured and transported on networks. You learn the distinction between packets and frames across OSI layers, see how IP and TCP/UDP headers support routing and reliability, and explore how the TCP/IP model maps to practical networking. By comparing TCP and UDP, examining key headers, and working with common ports and simple labs, you build intuition for how real‑world traffic is formed, transmitted, and interpreted. This knowledge is essential for analysing network behaviour and troubleshooting connectivity issues in later security work.

<details>
  <summary>Extending Your Network</summary>

## Introduction

The **Extending Your Network** TryHackMe room builds on core LAN ideas by covering how services reach the Internet (**port forwarding**), how **firewalls** filter traffic, how **VPNs** link remote sites and protect data, and how **routers**, **switches**, and **VLANs** fit together at different OSI layers. You also work through browser-based labs: configuring a simple firewall ruleset, and stepping through a **network simulator** that shows how packets and TCP handshakes move between hosts.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Port forwarding**
  - Without port forwarding, a service such as a web server on `192.168.1.10:80` is only reachable on the **local network** (an **intranet**).
  - To make that service reachable from the **Internet**, an administrator configures **port forwarding** on the **router** so traffic to the network’s **public IP** (e.g. `82.62.51.70`) is sent to the correct internal host and port.
  - **Port forwarding** opens or maps specific ports (how packets are addressed to services). It is **not** the same as a **firewall**: the firewall decides **whether** traffic may pass, even when ports are forwarded.
- [x] **Firewalls**
  - A firewall controls what traffic may **enter** or **leave** a network—like border control.
  - Decisions can depend on **source**, **destination**, **port**, **protocol** (e.g. TCP vs UDP), and similar policy; firewalls use **packet inspection** to apply rules.
  - Implementations range from dedicated hardware to home routers and software such as **Snort**.
  - **Stateful** firewalls use **whole-connection** context (dynamic, resource-intensive; may block a host if a connection is bad).
  - **Stateless** firewalls use **static per-packet** rules (lighter, but only as good as the rules; useful for high volume, e.g. mitigating **DDoS**-style floods).
  - For this room’s quiz: firewalls are associated with OSI layers **3 & 4** (numbers in ascending order, separated by `&`).
- [x] **Firewall lab (static site)**
  - Legitimate traffic is green; malicious traffic is red. The task is to block the malicious flow to the web server at **203.0.110.1** on **port 80** while allowing good traffic—room flag: `THM{FIREWALLS_RULE}`.
- [x] **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**
  - A VPN creates an encrypted **tunnel** over the Internet so devices on different physical networks behave like one **private** network.
  - Example: two offices (**Network #1** and **Network #2**) plus a third logical network (**Network #3**) formed only by VPN-connected devices that can talk securely among themselves.
  - Benefits include linking **geographically separate** sites, **encryption** (protecting data from sniffing, e.g. on public Wi‑Fi), and **privacy/anonymity** (with the caveat that a VPN provider that **logs** traffic undermines anonymity).
  - **TryHackMe** uses a VPN so you can reach vulnerable lab machines **safely** without exposing those machines directly to the public Internet (and so traffic patterns align with acceptable use).
- [x] **VPN technologies (overview)**
  - **PPP**: Used with **PPTP** for **authentication** and **encryption**; relies on matching **private key** and **certificate**; **not routable** by itself.
  - **PPTP**: **Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol**—carries PPP so data can **leave** the network; widely supported and easy to set up but **weakly encrypted** compared with alternatives.
  - **IPSec**: **Internet Protocol Security**—encrypts within the **IP** framework; **strong** encryption and broad device support but **harder** to configure.
- [x] **Routers**
  - A **router** **connects** networks and forwards traffic between them; the process is **routing** (verb **routing**).
  - Routers operate at **Layer 3** of the OSI model and often expose a **web or console UI** for **port forwarding** and **firewall** rules.
  - When multiple paths exist, routing protocols consider factors such as **shortest path**, **reliability**, and **link type** (e.g. copper vs fibre).
- [x] **Switches**
  - A **switch** connects **many** devices (the room cites a range such as **3–63**) over **Ethernet**.
  - **Layer 2** switches forward **frames** using **MAC** addresses (IP packets sit inside frames).
  - **Layer 3** switches forward frames **and** can **route** packets using **IP**—they combine switch and some router behaviour. A Layer 2 switch does **not** perform Layer 3 routing.
- [x] **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**
  - **VLANs** **logically** separate devices on the same physical infrastructure (e.g. **Sales** vs **Accounting**), improving **security** and policy control while still sharing uplinks such as Internet access.
- [x] **Network simulator lab**
  - Use **Chrome** or **Firefox**. Send a **TCP** packet from **computer1** to **computer3** to reveal the flag `THM{YOU'VE_GOT_DATA}`.
  - The room also asks how many **HANDSHAKE** entries appear in the **Network Log** (answer in the Q&A section).

## Terminal Commands

This room is taught mainly through diagrams, firewall and VPN concepts, and **in-browser** labs (firewall static site, packet simulator). Router and firewall **configuration** is usually done through a **web administration** interface on the device rather than a fixed CLI script in the lesson.

```bash
# No primary command-line workflow is emphasised in this room.
# Port forwarding and firewall rules are typically applied in the router/gateway admin UI.
```

## Code

There is no programming track in this room; learning is conceptual plus interactive web labs.

```py
# No code snippets for the Extending Your Network room.
```

- [x] **Snort** (intrusion detection / network security software used as an example of a software firewall category).

</details>

## Summary

**Extending Your Network** ties together how internal services are exposed (**port forwarding** on the **router**), how **firewalls** enforce allow/deny policy at layers **3 and 4** using **stateful** or **stateless** inspection, and how **VPNs** (PPP, PPTP, **IPSec**) extend and protect connectivity. You also reinforce **routing** vs switching, **Layer 2 vs Layer 3** switches, and **VLAN** segmentation. Hands-on items include a **firewall** rules lab, a **packet/network simulator** with TCP handshake visibility, and flags that anchor the concepts in practice.

## 3-How The Web Works

<details>
  <summary>DNS in Detail</summary>

## Introduction

**DNS (Domain Name System)** maps human-friendly **domain names** (e.g. `tryhackme.com`) to **IP addresses** (e.g. `104.26.10.229`) so you do not have to memorise numeric addresses. The room walks through **domain hierarchy** (root, TLD, second-level domain, subdomains), common **DNS record types** (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT), and the **resolution path** from your machine through **recursive** and **authoritative** servers, including **caching** and **TTL**. A browser-based DNS lab lets you query a sample zone and compare results to command-line tools.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **What DNS does**
  - Every host on the Internet has an **IP address** (IPv4 example: four octets **0–255**, e.g. `104.26.10.229`).
  - DNS lets you use **names** instead of remembering those numbers for every service.
- [x] **Domain hierarchy**
  - **Root** sits at the top of the tree, then **TLDs**, then **second-level** names, then optional **subdomains** left of the second-level label (separated by dots).
- [x] **TLD (Top-Level Domain)**
  - The **rightmost** label of a registered name (e.g. `.com` in `tryhackme.com`).
  - **gTLD** (generic): historically hinted at purpose (`.com` commercial, `.org` organisation, `.edu` education, `.gov` government); many **new gTLDs** exist (`.online`, `.club`, `.website`, `.biz`, etc.).
  - **ccTLD** (country code): geographic use, e.g. `.ca` (Canada), **`.co.uk`** (United Kingdom).
- [x] **Second-level domain**
  - In `tryhackme.com`, **tryhackme** is the second-level name and **.com** is the TLD.
  - Registration rules: up to **63** characters for that label plus TLD; characters **a–z**, **0–9**, **hyphens** (not at ends, no consecutive hyphens).
- [x] **Subdomain**
  - Left of the second-level name, e.g. **`admin`** in `admin.tryhackme.com`.
  - Same **63-character** rule per label; **underscores are not** allowed in the subdomain label (the room’s quiz contrasts characters including `\_`).
  - You can chain multiple labels (e.g. `jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com`); the **full** domain name must be **253** characters or fewer. There is **no fixed cap** on how many subdomain levels you create.
- [x] **Common DNS record types**
  - **A**: resolves to an **IPv4** address (e.g. `104.26.10.229`).
  - **AAAA**: resolves to an **IPv6** address (e.g. `2606:4700:20::681a:be5`).
  - **CNAME**: points to **another hostname**; the client must then resolve that name (e.g. `store.tryhackme.com` → `shops.shopify.com`).
  - **MX**: mail exchangers for the domain—**hosts** that receive email, with a **priority** number (lower often tried first).
  - **TXT**: arbitrary **text**—SPF/DMARC, domain verification, ACME challenges, etc.
- [x] **What happens on a DNS query**
  1. Your system checks a **local cache** (recent lookups).
  2. If needed, it asks a **recursive DNS server** (often your **ISP**’s resolver; you can choose another).
  3. The recursive resolver also **caches**; if it has a fresh answer, it returns it (common for popular sites).
  4. Otherwise resolution walks **root** → **TLD** server for the domain’s TLD (e.g. `.com`) → **authoritative** name servers for the zone (often several for redundancy).
  5. The **authoritative** server stores the **zone records** for that domain; updates to DNS are made there.
  6. Answers flow back to the recursive server, are **cached** (subject to **TTL**), then returned to your machine.
- [x] **TTL (Time To Live)**
  - A number in **seconds** telling resolvers how long they may **cache** that record before refreshing.

## Terminal Commands

The room’s embedded tool shows equivalent CLI commands. On Linux/macOS you can query records with **`dig`** or **`nslookup`**. Replace the domain with your target.

```bash
# IPv4 address (A record)
dig +short A example.com

# IPv6 (AAAA)
dig +short AAAA example.com

# Mail exchangers (MX) — note priority in the left column
dig +short MX example.com

# TXT records
dig +short TXT example.com

# CNAME chain (follow)
dig +short CNAME store.example.com
```

```bash
# nslookup (interactive or one-shot)
nslookup -type=A www.example.com
nslookup -type=MX example.com
```

## Code

TXT records are plain strings. Examples from the room’s style of content:

```text
_acme-challenge.example.com TXT "token_value_here"
@ TXT "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 include:_spf.google.com include:amazonses.com ~all"
_dmarc.example.com TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com; adkim=s; aspf=s; pct=100"
@ TXT "MS=ms12345678"
```

## Summary

**DNS in Detail** explains how names map to addresses, how **FQDNs** are built from TLDs, registrable labels, and subdomains, and how **A**, **AAAA**, **CNAME**, **MX**, and **TXT** records differ. You follow the **recursive** resolution path from cache and ISP resolvers through **root** and **TLD** servers to **authoritative** data, and you see how **TTL** controls caching. The hands-on zone reinforces reading **CNAME**, **TXT**, **MX** priority, and **A** records in a realistic lookup workflow.

<details>
  <summary>HTTP in Detail</summary>

## Introduction

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the rule set browsers and servers use to exchange **web resources**—HTML, images, video, and more—developed by Tim Berners-Lee’s team (1989–1991). **HTTPS** adds **encryption** and stronger **server identity** (certificates) so traffic cannot be read trivially in transit and impersonation is harder. This room also breaks down **URLs**, **request/response** lines and **headers**, **methods**, **status codes**, **cookies**, and ends with an **HTTP request emulator** where you earn flags for specific **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** calls.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **HTTP vs HTTPS**
  - **HTTP**: plaintext rules for talking to **web servers** and transferring page assets.
  - **HTTPS**: HTTP over a secure channel; the **S** stands for **secure**—data is **encrypted**, and TLS helps assure you reach the **real** server (not a simple impostor).
  - Interactive task: find the certificate problem on the mock page → flag `THM{INVALID_HTTP_CERT}`.
- [x] **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)**
  - A URL is an **instruction** for **how** and **where** to fetch a resource.
  - **Scheme**: protocol to use (**http**, **https**, **ftp**, …).
  - **User** (optional): `user:password` embedded for services that accept it.
  - **Host**: **domain name** or **IP** of the server.
  - **Port**: TCP port (often **80** for HTTP, **443** for HTTPS; valid range **1–65535**).
  - **Path**: resource path on the server (e.g. `/view-room`).
  - **Query string**: extra parameters after `?` (e.g. `?id=1`).
  - **Fragment**: client-side anchor after `#` (e.g. `#task3`), often scrolls to part of a page.
  - Full example from the room:
    `http://user:password@tryhackme.com:80/view-room?id=1#task3`
- [x] **Making requests and reading responses**
  - A minimal request line: `GET / HTTP/1.1`
  - Extra context goes in **headers** (`Host`, `User-Agent`, `Referer`, …).
  - Requests end with a **blank line** after headers.
  - Responses start with a **status line** (version + **status code** + reason), then headers, blank line, then **body** (e.g. HTML).
- [x] **Example request/response (room)**
  - Request uses **HTTP/1.1**, `Host: tryhackme.com`, `User-Agent`, `Referer`.
  - Response `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` with `Server`, `Date`, `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, then HTML body.
  - **`Content-Length`** tells the client **how many bytes** the body contains so it knows the response is complete.
- [x] **HTTP methods (common)**
  - **GET**: **retrieve** resources (e.g. read a news article).
  - **POST**: **submit** data, often **create** new records (e.g. new user account).
  - **PUT**: **update** existing data (e.g. change email).
  - **DELETE**: **remove** resources (e.g. delete an uploaded picture).
- [x] **Status code ranges**
  - **1xx**: informational (continue) — uncommon today.
  - **2xx**: **success**.
  - **3xx**: **redirection**.
  - **4xx**: **client** errors.
  - **5xx**: **server** errors.
- [x] **Common status codes (room)**
  - **200** OK — success.
  - **201** Created — resource created (new user, blog post).
  - **301** Moved Permanently — permanent redirect.
  - **302** Found — temporary redirect.
  - **400** Bad Request — malformed or incomplete request.
  - **401** Not Authorised — **authentication** required (e.g. editing profile while logged out).
  - **403** Forbidden — not allowed even if authenticated.
  - **404** Not Found — no such page/resource.
  - **405** Method Not Allowed — wrong verb for the route (e.g. GET where POST expected).
  - **500** Internal **Server** Error — server-side failure handling the request (room text says “Service” in one place; the usual phrase is **Internal Server Error**).
  - **503** Service Unavailable — overload or maintenance (room uses this for “cannot access database” / unavailable scenario).
- [x] **Request headers (selection)**
  - **Host**: which **site** on a shared server you want (virtual hosting).
  - **User-Agent**: browser/OS string so the server can tailor content.
  - **Content-Length** (request): size of body when **posting** form/API data.
  - **Accept-Encoding**: compression algorithms the client supports.
  - **Cookie**: sends **stored** cookies back to the server.
- [x] **Response headers (selection)**
  - **Set-Cookie**: tells the browser to **store** a cookie for later requests.
  - **Cache-Control**: how long to cache the response.
  - **Content-Type**: MIME type of the body (HTML, JSON, image, …).
  - **Content-Encoding**: compression used on the body.
- [x] **Cookies and statelessness**
  - HTTP is **stateless**—each request is independent; **cookies** carry a **token** or identifier so the server can recognise sessions, preferences, or auth **across** requests.
  - Cookies are set via **`Set-Cookie`** responses and returned on subsequent requests in the **`Cookie`** header (often **not** the cleartext password—a **token**).
  - Use **Developer Tools → Network** to inspect requests, responses, and **Cookies** per resource.

## Terminal Commands

You can reproduce many room ideas with **`curl`**: methods, headers, and viewing status lines. Replace hosts and paths as needed.

```bash
# Simple GET (shows response headers with -i)
curl -i https://tryhackme.com/

# GET with query string
curl -i "https://example.com/blog?id=1"

# POST form fields
curl -i -X POST -d "username=thm&password=letmein" https://example.com/login

# PUT with body
curl -i -X PUT -d "username=admin" https://example.com/user/2

# DELETE
curl -i -X DELETE https://example.com/user/1
```

## Code

Example **HTTP/1.1** request and response from the room (abbreviated for study):

```http

- [x] **POST** `/login` (`username=thm`, `password=letmein`) → `THM{HTTP_REQUEST_MASTER}`

</details>

## Summary

**HTTP in Detail** explains how browsers and servers exchange resources using **URLs**, **HTTP/1.1** request lines and **headers**, and structured **responses** with **status codes** from **1xx** through **5xx**. You compare **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**, interpret common codes like **200**, **201**, **401**, **404**, and **503**, and see how **cookies** compensate for HTTP’s **stateless** nature via **`Set-Cookie`** and **`Cookie`**. The mock certificate exercise and the **request emulator** turn the theory into short, flag-based practice.

  <summary>How Websites Work</summary>

## Introduction

**How Websites Work** explains what happens when you open a page: your **browser** sends a **request** to a **web server**, and the server returns **data** the browser uses to **render** the page. You learn the split between **front end** (what the browser shows) and **back end** (the server that processes requests), how **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** fit together, core **HTML structure** and **attributes**, hands-on **flags** from small HTML/JS labs, and two important **client-side** risks: **sensitive data exposure** in page source and **HTML injection** when user input is not **sanitised**.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Browser and web server**
  - Your browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari) **requests** a page from a **web server**—a computer elsewhere that handles requests and returns a **response**.
  - The response contains data the browser uses to **display** the page; many steps happen under the hood, but the core idea is **request → response → render**.
- [x] **Front end vs back end**
  - **Front end (client-side)**: how the **browser** renders and presents the site.
  - **Back end (server-side)**: the **server** that **processes** the request and returns a response.
- [x] **Building websites: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
  - **HTML**: structure and content of pages.
  - **CSS**: styling and layout.
  - **JavaScript**: interactivity and dynamic behaviour on the page.
- [x] **HTML basics**
  - **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)** uses **elements** (**tags**) as building blocks; tags tell the browser **how** to show content.
  - **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: declares an **HTML5** document—helps **standardisation** across browsers.
  - **`<html>`**: **root** element; other elements nest inside it.
  - **`<head>`**: **metadata** about the page (e.g. title)—not the main visible body content.
  - **`<body>`**: the document **body**; only content here is typically **shown** in the browser window.
  - **`<h1>`**: a large **heading**; **`<p>`**: a **paragraph**.
  - Many other tags exist: **`<button>`**, **`<img>`**, lists, etc.
- [x] **Attributes (`class`, `src`, `id`)**
  - Tags can have **attributes**, e.g. **`class`** for styling (`<p class="bold-text">`), **`src`** on **`<img>`** for image location (`<img src="img/cat.jpg">`).
  - Multiple attributes per element are allowed: `<p attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">`.
  - **`id`**: should be **unique** on the page; **`class`** can be shared across many elements. **`id`** helps with styling and **JavaScript** targeting.
- [x] **Viewing HTML source**
  - **Chrome**: right-click → **View Page Source**.
  - **Safari**: **Show Page Source** (and related menu naming).
- [x] **HTML playground tasks (room)**
  - Fix a **broken image** on the cat page to reveal a hidden answer → flag **`HTMLHERO`**.
  - Add a **dog** image with **`<img>`** using **`img/dog-1.png`** → read text in the image → flag **`DOGHTML`**.
- [x] **JavaScript (JS)**
  - JS makes pages **interactive**; without it, pages stay **static**.
  - Inline: **`<script>`** … **`</script>`** or external: `<script src="/location/of/javascript_file.js"></script>`.
  - Example: `document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";` targets **`id="demo"`** and changes its content.
  - **Events** like **`onclick`** or **`onhover`** run JS when the user interacts; e.g. a button can change text on click. Task flag: **`JSISFUN`** when the demo text is set to **Hack the Planet**; add the **Button Clicked** button example and render **HTML+JS** as instructed.
- [x] **Sensitive data exposure**
  - Occurs when **sensitive** information is left in **clear text** in the **front end** (e.g. HTML or JS **source**).
  - Developers may forget to remove **credentials**, **hidden links**, or notes—visible via **View Source**.
  - Example room password in source: **`testpasswd`**.
  - **Assessment tip**: reviewing **page source** early can reveal **credentials** or **hidden links** useful to an attacker.
- [x] **HTML injection**
  - Happens when **user input** is **echoed** to the page **without sanitisation**; the browser may treat attacker-supplied **HTML** (or **script**) as real markup.
  - **Sanitise** (filter) input before use; **never trust user input**; related deeper topics include **SQL injection** on the server side.
  - Room task: inject HTML so a **malicious link** to `http://hacker.com` appears → flag **`HTML_INJ3CTI0N`**.

## Terminal Commands

The room emphasises **browser** tools and **view source**. On the command line you can still **fetch** HTML to inspect (similar to viewing source offline):

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/ | head -n 50
```

Use **find** / **grep** locally on saved HTML if you mirror a page for review (optional workflow).

```bash
grep -n "password\|passwd\|secret" saved.html
```

## Code

Minimal HTML document structure (room-style):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text.</p>
    <img src="img/cat.jpg" alt="Cat" />
    <p class="bold-text">Styled paragraph</p>
    <p id="example">Unique id example</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

JavaScript examples from the room:

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";
```

```html
<button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Button Clicked";'>
  Click Me!
</button>
```

  <summary>Putting it all together</summary>

## Introduction

**Putting it all together** recaps the **full path** from typing a URL to seeing a page: **DNS** resolves the host, **HTTP** carries the conversation, and the server returns **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **images** for the browser to render. The room then adds infrastructure pieces that make the web **scale** and **safer**: **load balancers**, **CDNs**, **databases**, and **WAFs**; **how web servers** serve files from a **document root**, use **virtual hosts** for many sites on one machine, and distinguish **static** vs **dynamic** content and **backend** languages—with a **drag-and-drop** quiz that unlocks a flag when you order the request flow correctly.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **End-to-end picture (from earlier modules)**
  - Your computer needs the server’s **IP** → **DNS** resolves the name.
  - The client talks to the server using **HTTP**; the server returns **HTML**, **JS**, **CSS**, **images**, etc., and the browser **formats** and **displays** the site.
- [x] **Load balancers**
  - Used when **traffic** is large or **high availability** is required—one server may not suffice.
  - **Two main roles**: spread load across servers; provide **failover** if a server stops responding.
  - The **load balancer** receives the request first, then **forwards** it to one of several **backend** servers.
  - **Algorithms** include **round-robin** (each server in turn) and **weighted** (e.g. send to the **least busy** server).
  - **Health checks**: periodic probes to each server; if a server fails or misbehaves, traffic is **stopped** until it recovers.
- [x] **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**
  - Hosts **static** assets (**JS**, **CSS**, **images**, **video**) on **many servers worldwide**.
  - Sends the user to a **geographically nearby** edge server instead of always hitting the origin—**reduces latency** and **origin load**.
- [x] **Databases**
  - Sites often **store** and **retrieve** user data; web servers talk to **databases** (from simple files to large clusters).
  - Examples: **MySQL**, **MSSQL**, **MongoDB**, **Postgres**—each with different features.
- [x] **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
  - Sits **between** the client’s request and the **web server**.
  - Goals: protect against **hacking** and **denial-of-service**; inspect requests for **common attacks**; distinguish **real browsers** from **bots**; **rate limiting** (cap requests per **IP** per time window). Suspicious requests can be **dropped** before they reach the app server.
- [x] **Web servers (software)**
  - Software that **listens** for connections and uses **HTTP** to deliver content—e.g. **Apache**, **Nginx**, **IIS**, **Node.js**.
  - Serves files from a configured **root** (document root), e.g. **`/var/www/html`** on Linux for **Nginx/Apache** defaults, **`C:\inetpub\wwwroot`** on Windows for **IIS**.
  - Example: `http://www.example.com/picture.jpg` maps to a file under that root, e.g. **`/var/www/html/picture.jpg`** on disk.
- [x] **Virtual hosts**
  - One server can host **many domain names** via **virtual host** configuration; the server reads the **hostname** from **HTTP headers** and maps to the right **site** and **document root** (e.g. `one.com` → `/var/www/website_one`, `two.com` → `/var/www/website_two`). No fixed limit on how many sites per server.
- [x] **Static vs dynamic content**
  - **Static**: files served **as-is** (images, CSS, JS, HTML that does not change per request).
  - **Dynamic**: output can **change** per request (e.g. blog homepage with latest posts, search results)—work happens in the **backend** with **programming/scripting** languages; the browser sees the **resulting HTML**, not the server-side source.
- [x] **Backend languages**
  - Examples: **PHP**, **Python**, **Ruby**, **Node.js**, **Perl**—talk to **databases**, call **APIs**, process **user input**, etc.
  - **PHP** example: `index.php?name=adam` with `<?php echo $_GET["name"]; ?>` outputs **Hello adam**; the client **does not** receive the raw PHP source.
- [x] **Quiz task**
  - Drag-and-drop tiles into the **correct order** of how a **request to a website** works; correct slots turn **green**, wrong **red**; avoid **refreshing** (resets tiles). Flag: **`THM{YOU_GOT_THE_ORDER}`**.

## Terminal Commands

Default **document roots** are configuration choices—on Linux servers you often see:

```bash
ls -la /var/www/html
```

On Windows with IIS:

```powershell
dir C:\inetpub\wwwroot
```

Use your distro’s package docs to locate **`nginx`** / **`apache2`** site configs for **virtual hosts** (e.g. under `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` or `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`).

## Code

Dynamic page example from the room (PHP): the **server** runs PHP; the **browser** only gets HTML.

```php
<html><body>Hello <?php echo $_GET["name"]; ?></body></html>
```

Rendered response to the client:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    Hello adam
  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

### Question 3: What can help **protect a website** against hacking (and related abuse) in front of the app server?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] A **WAF** (Web Application Firewall).

</details>

### Question 4: What **two main features** do load balancers provide for busy or critical sites?

<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **`C:\inetpub\wwwroot`**

</details>

### Question 9: What does **web server** software use to **host multiple websites** with different domain names?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Virtual hosts** (hostname from the request is matched to configuration).

</details>

### Question 10: What is the name for the type of content that **can change** with different requests?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Dynamic** content.

</details>

### Question 11: Does the **client** see the **backend** (e.g. PHP) source code as delivered by the server?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Nay**—the browser receives the **processed result** (e.g. HTML), not the raw server-side code.

</details>

### Question 12: What **database** examples does the room mention?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **MySQL**
- [x] **MSSQL**
- [x] **MongoDB**

</details>

### Question 13: What **flag** do you get after ordering the **request flow** tiles correctly in the quiz?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **`THM{YOU_GOT_THE_ORDER}`**

</details>

### Question 14: What is **rate limiting** in the WAF context?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Allowing only up to a **certain number of requests per IP** (per second / time window) to block abusive or automated floods.

</details>

### Question 15: In one sentence, what is the difference between **static** and **dynamic** content?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Static** content is served **unchanged** from files; **dynamic** content is **generated or selected per request** on the **backend** before the response is sent.

</details>

## Summary

**Putting it all together** connects **DNS**, **HTTP**, and returned assets to the bigger picture: **load balancers** and **health checks**, **CDNs** for **static** files, **databases** for persisted data, **WAFs** with **rate limiting**, **web server** roots and **virtual hosts**, **static** vs **dynamic** pages, and **backend** languages where users never see raw **PHP**-style source. The **ordering quiz** reinforces the pipeline and awards **`THM{YOU_GOT_THE_ORDER}`**.
